## Disaster Recovery Plan SOP (NIST-Based)
## Purpose:
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to establish a structured framework for developing and implementing a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) in compliance with the guidelines and standards set forth by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This SOP aims to ensure the resilience of IT systems and data in the face of disasters or disruptions.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides several documents and publications related to IT disaster recovery. One of the key publications is NIST Special Publication 800-34 Revision 1, "Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems.
## Scope:
This SOP applies to all IT and data management aspects within the organization, including hardware, software, communication systems, and data storage.
## Responsibilities:
-Disaster Recovery Coordinator: Responsible for overseeing the development, implementation, and testing of the DRP.
-IT Staff: Responsible for carrying out technical aspects of the DRP, including data backup, recovery, and system restoration.
-Security Personnel: Responsible for safeguarding IT systems and data from physical and cyber threats.
-Management: Responsible for providing the necessary support and resources to implement and maintain the DRP.
## Prerequisites:
-Familiarity with NIST guidelines and standards for disaster recovery.
-Access to relevant NIST documentation.
-An inventory of critical IT systems, data, and assets.
## Procedures:
## 1. Risk Assessment
## 1.1 Disaster Scenarios
-Identify and assess potential disaster scenarios, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, power outages, and hardware failures. Evaluate their potential impact on IT systems and data.
## 1.2 Critical Systems and Data
-Identify critical IT systems and data, prioritize them, and establish a comprehensive understanding of their functionality and dependencies.
## 2. Disaster Recovery Team
## 2.1 Roles and Responsibilities
-Define and assign roles and responsibilities within the disaster recovery team, including the Disaster Recovery Coordinator, IT staff, security personnel, and management.
## 2.2 Contact Information
-Maintain an up-to-date contact list for all team members, ensuring multiple contact methods are available.
## 3. Data Backup and Recovery
## 3.1 Data Backup Procedures
-Define backup schedules, methods, and locations for critical data, including data retention policies in line with NIST recommendations.
## 3.2 Data Recovery Procedures
-Detail the steps for data recovery, including restoration from backups, data integrity testing, and compliance with NIST data recovery standards.
## 4. IT System Recovery
## 4.1 Hardware and Software Inventory
-Maintain an inventory of hardware and software, including configuration details, licenses, and warranty information.
## 4.2 System Restoration
-Define procedures for restoring servers, networks, and critical applications in accordance with NIST guidelines.
## 4.3 Testing and Validation
-Conduct regular testing and validation of IT system recovery processes to ensure compliance with NIST standards.
## 5. Communication and Notification
## 5.1 Internal Communication
-Establish a clear internal communication plan to inform employees about disaster recovery efforts and provide instructions for continued operations.
## 5.2 External Communication
-Define external communication procedures, including how to notify customers, vendors, and stakeholders about service disruptions and recovery timelines in alignment with NIST recommendations.
## 6. Training and Awareness
## 6.1 Training
-Ensure that IT and communication staff are adequately trained in disaster recovery procedures, including NIST-compliant methods and practices.
## 6.2 Awareness
-Promote awareness among all employees regarding disaster recovery protocols, reporting procedures, and emergency contact information, emphasizing NIST standards for data recovery.
## 7. Revision and Testing
## 7.1 Plan Review
-Regularly review and update the DRP to align with NIST standards and guidelines.
## 7.2 Testing
-Conduct periodic tests and drills to evaluate the effectiveness of the disaster recovery plan and identify areas for improvement in compliance with NIST recommendations.
