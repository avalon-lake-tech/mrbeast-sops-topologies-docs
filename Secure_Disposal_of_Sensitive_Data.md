## Secure Disposal of Sensitive Data SOP
## Purpose:
- The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to establish a secure and consistent process for the identification and disposal of storage media that may contain sensitive data to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access.
## Scope:
- This SOP applies to all employees responsible for handling and disposing of storage media within the organization.
## Responsibilities:
- IT Department: Responsible for overseeing and managing the data disposal process.
- All Employees: Responsible for identifying and returning storage media for disposal in a timely manner.
## Prerequisites:
- Clear identification of storage media that may contain sensitive data.
- Access to data wiping or secure erasure software.
- Secure and authorized data destruction methods.
## Procedures:
## Data Disposal Procedure:
### Identify Storage Media:
- Regularly identify all storage media that may contain sensitive data, including hard drives, USB drives, and other removable storage devices. This should be done during hardware inventory checks.
### Use Data Wiping or Secure Erasure Software:
- When sensitive data is identified on storage media, initiate the data wiping or secure erasure process using authorized software.
- Ensure that data wiping or erasure software meets industry standards for data destruction and security.
### Physically Destroy Storage Media:
- In cases where erasure is not possible, physically destroy the storage media to prevent data recovery. This should be done using authorized methods (e.g., shredding, degaussing).
### Maintain Records:
- Maintain a record of all disposed storage media, including the date of disposal and the method used (data wiping, physical destruction, or other). This record should be kept for compliance and audit purposes.
